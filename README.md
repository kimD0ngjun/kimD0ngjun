My name is Jun😊 I've come across development as a front-end, and I want to expand my reach to the back-end and artificial intelligence fields. I enjoy drinking alone, but I don't drink often🍺 and it's just a means of contemplation. Sometimes I write down and consider it📝, or I play the piano🎹

Sometimes GitHub is quiet, maybe it's because I forgot to upload the repository...😅 I'm so into my own projects while eating late-night snacks (probably chicken🍗). It's been so long since my days and nights changed, and my insomnia still doesn't get better.

I want to actively lead beyond being flexible in responding to sudden changes in technological flow. My goal is to become a developer who brings out the virtuous cycle value of collaboration while interacting with what I know :)
